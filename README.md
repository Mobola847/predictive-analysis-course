# Assignment 5 Repository
This repository consists of code for the Predictive Analysis course at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/) college.

## Unit 5 - K Means Algorithm

This is the fifth assisgnment in R, [K Means Algorithm](https://github.com/Mobola847/predictive-analysis-course/blob/main/Assignment5.Rmd)

The mammal_Sleep dataset contains information on sleep habits for 83 mammals. 
Features include total sleep, length of the sleep cycle, time spent awake, brain weight, and body weight. 
Animals are also labeled with their name, genus, and conservation status. Here are the tasks
1. Load the dataset mammal_Sleep.csv into a data frame.
2. Create a new data frame mammalSleep with sleep_total and sleep_rem.
3. Fit a k-means clustering model with 4 clusters to the data subset mammalSleep.
4. Find the centroids of the clusters in the model on the chart
5. (If you canâ€™t figure how to it using fviz_cluster function, you can use plot() or geom_point().
