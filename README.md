# Assignment 4 Repository
This repository consists of code for the Predictive Analysis course at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/) college.

## Unit 5 - Linear Regression

This is the third assisgnment in R, [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Mobola847/predictive-analysis-course/blob/main/Assign4_Coffee.Rmd)
Coffee and Blood Pressure
Scenario One
You have been told that there is a correlation between coffee consumption and blood pressure. In order to statistically test the relationship you have collected data from 48 coffee drinkers, including the number of cups of coffee they have consumed and their blood pressures. Now you want to run a linear regression to see if there is any relationship between coffee consumption and blood pressure.
Tasks
Use the dataset on the “Coffee & Blood Pressure” tab of the datasheet to complete the following: 
1. Find the correlation between coffee consumption and blood pressure using the scatter plot
2. Describe the relationship between coffee consumption and blood pressure and explain what someone should do if their doctor says that their blood pressure is a concern.
3. Train the model and predict the values for 180 and 190 blood pressure.
